# Smart_Parking_System
We had come up with a solution to the problem faced by almost everyone of parking in this modern world. So, getting the right information about space available in the parking lot is very important to the drivers in our city so that they donâ€™t waste their time looking for parking spaces or park inappropriately because of lack of information. An Internet of Things (IoT) based Smart Parking System informs the user to find out the availability of parking slots in this parking lot. Our project mainly focuses on reducing time in finding the parking slots. It also avoid the need to travel unnecessarily through filled parking spaces in the parking lot. In this way, it will also help to reduce the fuel consumption which in turn will reduce carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere. In this project, we check the status of each parking space in the parking lot and then send the sensor data to the database. Then this data is sent to the Web Server and finally the data is displayed on the website.
